Loren's Feedback:
Really cool idea. I definitely think the iteration method would bias the star distribution; since this all needs to be inside a Rand, you could maybe try randomizing the order in which you consider generating a star at a location.
Bhakti's Feedback:
I love it! Excited to see how it goes. Maybe one of the stars can be matthew mcconaughey ... Some low hanging fruit i see is adding a user interface (graphical or textual, take your pick) for allowing the user to enter their parameters, if this isn't something you had already considered .

Score: 3/3
