Our project is coming along well, and the core of the randomness is working.
We are able to generate quite large images in a reasonable amount of time with
a random placement of star centers. The star centers can be filled outwards
to a random radius in a circular pattern (using the midpoint circle algorithm).
We have a function that generates a randomly offset luminance value that decays
as pixels get further from the center using a gaussian distribution.

We are still working on debugging the placement of coordinates after the star
circle generation; the circle generation function uses a different coordinate
system (standard cartesian coordinates) than the image coordinates.

We plan on adding colors and possibly incorporating Perlin Noise to add some
variety to the image generation. Lastly, we plan to make a terminal-based
interface for generating the image given some parameters from the user.
