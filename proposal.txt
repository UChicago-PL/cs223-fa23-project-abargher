TLDR: We are going to take up Professor Chugh's suggestion of making our project
based off of Interstellar. To do this, we are going to use random functions and
distance parameters to draw stars that are of a specific density.

Topics relevant to the course include:
- Image Generation
- Recursion
- Colorful Image / Text
- Command Line Arguments
- Lists and their functions
