Stars of Chance

by Alec Bargher & Victor Brown
-----------

TLDR: We are going to take up Professor Chugh's suggestion of making our project
based off of Interstellar. To do this, we are going to use random functions and
distance parameters to draw a galaxy-like image with randomly generated stars
of varying density

Topics relevant to the course include:
- Image Generation
- Recursion
- Colorful Image / Text
- Command Line Arguments
- Lists and their functions

Easy goals:
- Assign colors randomly
- Generating a basic image
- allow user input for image parameters

Medium goals:
- randomly pick star "center" points
  

Challenge goals:
- Density function(s) for star proximity and for pixels comprising a single star
- assign random "brightness" value (star size)
  - to give stars a bright center appearance where they are dimmer at edges
