Stars of Chance

TLDR: We are going to take up Professor Chugh's suggestion of making our project
based off of Interstellar. To do this, we are going to use random functions and
distance parameters to draw a galaxy-like image with randomly generated stars
of varying density

Topics relevant to the course include:
- Image Generation
- Recursion
- Colorful Image / Text
- Command Line Arguments
- Lists and their functions

Easy goals:
- Assign colors randomly
- Generating a basic image
- allow user input for image parameters

Medium goals:
- randomly pick star "center" points
  

Challenge goals:
- Density function(s) for star proximity and for pixels comprising a single star
- assign random "brightness" value (star size)
  - to give stars a bright center appearance where they are dimmer at edges

==============

Picture this, you've just watched Interstellar and you want to have your Matthew McConaughey style
adventure. Unfortunately, you've got no spaceship, no money, and no Carhartt Jacket (unless you're
THE Victor Brown). Fortunately, you do have Haskell, and all of the advantages that Functional Programming
gives us! Armed with a computer, you set out to draw the image to capture your dreams. Who needs the
stars to align when you've got... Stars of Chance.

The core of our star generation is picking where the centers of each star lie.
One method for picking these centers is to choose a fixed number of stars we
want to generate as well as a fixed minimum distance between all stars. Then,
we randomly generate an (x,y) position within the bounds of the desired image
size, and add it to a list of centers. If the randomly chosen position is not
at least the minimum distance away from all existing centers, we will "reroll"
and choose a new random position to try. We will also incorporate a limit on
the number of rerolls to prevent too many (and potentially infinitely many)
rerolls.
