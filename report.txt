The Stars of Chance is a program for procedurally/randomly generating images
resembling a starry space background.

The core of the program is in Stars.hs, which contains all of the functions
relating to generating the stars pixels and combining them with the background
color. All necessary parameters are retrieved from standard input. All the
input parsing is accomplished by MaybeT monad transformers in the
UserInterface.hs module. By using MaybeT monad transformers, the program will
terminate immediately if any invalid inputs are given by the user.

Lastly, since the random number generator is seeded only once at the beginning
of the program, we have added a command line flag to provide a specific seed
to the random number generator. By running the program as follows, as long
as the other arguments provided are the same, Stars of Chance can regenerate
the same image (in this case, with a seed of 12345).
  cabal run stars -- --seed 12345

Since the star colors are determined by choosing a random "percentage" along
the scale from star color 1 to star color 2, the star colors provided do not
affect anything about the procedural image generation. Therefore, two images
generated with the same seed and same arguments, but different star colors will
look the "same", except for the specific colors of each star. The 'shade' of
each star will match, as will the position, size, shape, etc.
